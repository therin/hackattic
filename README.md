# hackattic
my solutions to https://hackattic.com challenges (in progress):

- organised as Go package with main entry point in /cmd/exec
- individual challenges are located in /pkg/challenge_name
- functions that tend to be used between challenges are in /pkg/tools
- first Go experience, it's awesome!
